<h2 id="project-description">📌 Project Description </h2>

**RescueTails** is an application aimed at improving animal welfare by allowing citizens to report stray animals they find. Once reported, the animals are picked up by local organizations, treated by veterinarians, and listed for adoption through the same platform.  
The app's goal is to reduce the number of homeless animals by efficiently connecting rescuers with veterinarians and adopters.


<h2 id="project-status">🚧 Project Status </h2>
Currently, **RescueTails** is in the development phase **(v1.0.0)**. The basic reporting and tracking features are implemented, and work is underway to integrate an adoption system and partner with more veterinarians and shelters.
